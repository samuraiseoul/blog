My name is Scott Lavigne and I'm a programmer by trade, focusing primarily on full stack web development. 
I'm currently employed as a Web Developer at Lifestyle Publications located in the heart of America, Kansas City. 
If you're looking to learn more about me and what I like to do, you're in the right place. Here I'll showcase all things programming
such as my projects and any other kind of programming articles I'd like to write. I also will showcase my other interests here including foreign languages
such as Japanese and Korean, some cooking posts, and also a fledgling interest in the field of mathmatics. 

If you want to talk to me or reach out for an opportunity, feel free to use any of the links in the sidebar! 

Happy Reading!
